    <h2>Description of the recipe</h2>
    <p>Chicken Makhani, also known as Butter Chicken, is a popular Indian dish featuring tender chicken simmered in a rich, creamy tomato-based sauce. Flavored with warm spices like garam masala and turmeric, it’s both comforting and flavorful. Often served with rice or naan, it's a favorite for its smooth, mildly spiced taste.</p>
